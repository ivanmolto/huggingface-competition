# SUBMISSION DESCRIPTION

The submission file must have two columns: `id` and `pred` which is the weight_a (ie the prediction of the weight of the project_a).
`pred` is a numeric value with 11 decimals.

The participants need to submit the prediction of the weight of the project_a for each of the records in the file `test.csv`

An example of `sample_submission.csv` is [here]()
